SYNOPSIS
        use Acme::DeepThoughts
        print "Hello world";

DESCRIPTION
    The first time you run a program under "use Acme::DeepThoughts", the
    module removes all the unsightly printable characters from your source
    file. The code continues to work exactly as it did before, but now it
    contains a *Deep Thought*.

    These deep thoughts were collected from <http://deepthoughts.330.ca/>,
    which is a site "*dedicated to the quotes that used to appear on the hit
    TV show, Saturday Night Live (SNL)*."
